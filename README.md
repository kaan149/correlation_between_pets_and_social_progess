# correlation_between_pets_and_social_progess
I wondered what kinda relation between number of pet's per people and social progess index by country![result](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56691210/124507417-72946600-ddd6-11eb-9ff6-28c835b9a39b.png)
The results are not as well inversely correlated as I expected but I'm considering doing the same experiment again with all kinda pets and much more country information.
Also the correlation result is -0.34
